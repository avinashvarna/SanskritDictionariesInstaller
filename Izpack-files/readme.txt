Namaste,

This program installs GoldenDict (www.goldendict.org) and all the Sanskrit 
dictionaries compiled by the sanskrit programmers group
https://sites.google.com/site/sanskritcode/dictionaries). 

This program is just a simple wrapper to make installing these various dictionaries 
easier on the windows platform. After installation, please look for the program 
under the Sanskrit Dictionaries Start Menu item (if you choose to create a start 
menu item). The installer will also create Desktop shortcuts if that option is 
chosen during installation.

Hope you enjoy using the dictionaries converted to this easy to use format by 
the hard work of the sanskrit programmers volunteer group!
